In order to learn event-driven programming in Python I opted to dive into Kivy and create my favourite on the road card game, Chicago. The source is here for all to peruse, it will hopefully prove useful to some. In there you can find example on how to:

 - Use Kivy to create an App that runs on both IOS and Android platforms (and potentially others)
 - Advertise on both IOS and Android (IOS work in progress)
 - Bill for in-app purchases on Android (IOS will hopfully come later)
 - Use of many different kinds of Kivy objects
